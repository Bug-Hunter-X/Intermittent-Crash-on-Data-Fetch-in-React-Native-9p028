# React Native Intermittent Crash Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug causing intermittent crashes in a React Native application during data fetching from a remote API.  The crash is sporadic and lacks a consistent error message, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

A React Native application using `fetch` to retrieve data from a remote API experiences random crashes.  The API itself is generally stable and returns data successfully most of the time.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the application using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
3. Observe that the application will work normally for a while but will eventually crash without a clear error message in the console.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing proper error handling and potentially adding retry logic. The provided solution implements these to improve the stability of the app.
